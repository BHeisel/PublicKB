Lumen deactivated the Canadian English (ca.ctl.io) and Canadian French (fr-ca.ctl.io) versions of CTL.io in June 2020 because they received very little traffic.

In the interest of aligning Lumen’s resources with the regions where we see the greatest demand, we made the difficult decision to take down the sites and redirect traffic to our English language site.

As a result, any of the URLs on those subdomains that you may have bookmarked will now redirect to this page.

We apologize for any inconvenience and want to make this transition as smooth as possible for you. The fastest way to reach the English version of the page you wanted to visit is to replace “fr-ca.” or “ca.” in the URL with “www.” This will direct you to the English version of the page.

We are grateful that you have chosen Lumen as your service provider and promise to continue to provide outstanding customer service and support. If you have any questions or comments about this action, please [let us know](https://www.ctl.io/contact/).
