### Description
OTP based multi-factor authentication can be enforced for multifactor required customers, optionally enabled by a user during registration, or from their account page anytime after registration.

OTP multi-factor authentication requires the use of a smart phone and compatible smart phone app (such as Google Authenticator or OTP Auth) or browser plug-in (such as Google Authenticator for Chrome)

### Steps

**1:** Multi-Factor Opt-in within User Registration

Select “One Time Password using OTP App” during user registration to enroll in Multi-Factor Authentication.

You can opt-in after registration by navigating to the Authentication tab in the left side navigation within Manage My Account.

**2:** Initial Login after User Registration

Once registration of the master account is complete, you are prompted to enter your credentials for your Lumen Master account for the first time after registration.

The QR code is valid for 3 minutes. The page includes a timer that will redirect you when the code expires.
With your compatible smart phone application (such as Google Authenticator), click the add or + button to configure their Multi-Factor account.

If you cannot scan the QR code you can click the QR code to reveal a secret key that can be used to manually configure the OTP app (e.g. GoogleAuthenticator for Chrome).

**4:** Multi Factor Authentication OTP Code

After registration of your Multi Factor OTP, you will be prompted to enter the 6 digit code provided on your OTP smart phone app to complete your login process.  You will be prompted to enter this code after every subsequent login with your Lumen Master Account.
