When setting the password for a user, it must meet the following complexity requirements.

- It must be at least 8 characters long.

- There must be a character from at least 3 of the categories listed below.
    - upper-case characters
    - lower-case characters
    - numbers
    - special characters

- The below characters **are not** permitted.

    ```
    ^&`|<>'"\;
    ```

For example, a password may have an upper-case character, a lower-case character, and a number. However, a password will be rejected if it only has upper-case and lower-case characters.
