### Description 
 
Lumen Edge Bare Metal servers introduce the ability to provision and manage physical machines from the Lumen Edge Orchestrator Platform in a self-service, on-demand, and highly automated fashion. 

This article goes into detail around the management of the physical Bare Metal machines that have already been provisioned.

### Instance Details
The instance detail page is where you can view and fully manage an instance. To get to an instances detail page, navigate to provisioning, instances, and click on an instance. Please note instance details and actions differ between instance types and user permissions.

There are several sections within an Instance page that provide useful capabilities and details to the user.

**How to delete a server**
