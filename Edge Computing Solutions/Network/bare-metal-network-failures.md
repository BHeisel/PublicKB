### Description

I am experiencing network performance issue or a network outage, what can I do?

Lumen Edge has built a highly redundant and resilient network that is monitored 24/7, thus individual hardware or circuit failures will be transparent to most of our customers.
Our operations teams do have scheduled maintenance windows, should maintenance or upgrades be required.
If these scheduled maintenance are customer impacting you will be notified.  
More information on maintenance windows and SLA’s can be found [here](https://www.ctl.io/legal/lumen-edge-bare-metal/sla/).

In the event you believe you are experiencing a performance issue or an outage please contact our Customer Care team who are available 24/7.

You will need to provide the “Tenant” or account name when reaching out to Customer Care.
