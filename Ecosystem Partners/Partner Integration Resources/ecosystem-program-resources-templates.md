Lumen [Ecosystem Program Partner Members](lumen-cloud-ecosystem-program-guide.md) gain access to a bevy of [resources](ecosystem-program-resources.md) that make integrations easy.

Creating server templates on Lumen Cloud enables customers to deploy bit-for-bit replicas of your software as a virtual appliance.

### Universal Deploy
This supports nearly any virtual appliance type including those that require console configuration on first boot.  These deploys are performed by Lumen operations staff as a service task and take longer to deploy.

### Universal Deploy Core Documentation
