### Description (Goal/Purpose)

This article will provide guidance on escalating a Public Cloud ticket for the following scenarios.

- A support request has just been submitted, and it needs to be executed immediately.
- A request has been submitted previously, and it now needs to be escalated.
- Public Cloud did not deliver on what was agreed in a ticket.

### Audience

- Accounts with a Paid Support Level (Details on these support agreements can be found on the [Public Cloud site's support page](//www.ctl.io/lumen-public-cloud/support).)

### Prerequisites

- Review the [ticket prioritization matrix](../Support/ticket-prioritization-matrix.md) for an understanding of the support prioritization for tickets, including expectations on response cadence and resolution time.
- Ensure that this issue requires escalation.
- Have someone available to respond to any information requests from Public Cloud. For the majority of the time, these requests will be made via the original ticket. Not having someone available could delay the resolution of the issue and defeats the purpose of the escalation mechanism.

### Steps

Send an ***new email*** to Public Cloud. Forwarding/copying escalation an existing ticket will prevent automation from handling the request properly, and an escalation will not occur. The email must have the following details.

  - To: escalation@ctl.io
  - Subject: `ESCALATION: Ticket - #` (example: "ESCALATION: Ticket - 1701234")
  - Body: Provide a brief explanation of why the ticket should be escalated.

A new ticket will be created in the system, and it will be automatically escalated to the Public Cloud operations management.

### FAQ

1. **Is this capability available 24x7?**  
Yes. While the management team is based on the US west coast, they do respond to escalations within 15 minutes.

2. **What criteria are used to evaluate a service request escalation?**  
The members of the escalation team are in the Public Cloud support management. They will review the following details of the original ticket.
    - time and date
    - clarity of information
    - scope
    - skill required

3. **Is there a charge for escalating a ticket?**  
In general, no. However, Public Cloud *does* reserve the right to charge parties that misuse the escalation mechanism.

4. **If the account does not have a paid support level, what will happen when this mechanism is used?**  
The automation will check to validate the account's support level. If the account does not have a paid support level, the escalation will not complete successfully.

5. **The issue was escalated but the resolution was not satisfactory. What can be done?**  
To further escalate to the executive level, send another email. Again, this must be a separate email; forwarding/copying executive escalation an existing ticket will prevent automation from handling the request properly, and an escalation will not occur. The email must have the following details.
    - To: execescalation@ctl.io
    - Subject: `ESCALATION: Ticket - #` (example: "ESCALATION: Ticket - 1701234")
    - Body: Provide a brief explanation of why the ticket should be escalated.
